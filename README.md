# Age-Gender-and-Sentiment-Analysis-to-Select-Relevant-Advertisements-for-a-User
In this project, I have used MobilNetV2 and EfficientNetB0 which are CNN models to predict the Age, Gender and Emotion of a user. 
A revelant advertisement link is opened from the csv file according to the attributes that are retrieved.
